      <p>
       Monster Party is designed by Andreea, George and Robert. It started out as a school project but 
       it looks like it will have a bright future.  We are a group of computer science students, trying
       to learn as much as possible about web technologies in a shortest amount of time, developing an awesome
       app as a side-product of this process. You will hear from us again for sure.

        The high-level goals of the game are to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improve Problem Solving Skills.</li>
        <li>Improve Concentration! Concentration is required to solve a brainteaser.
            Therefore puzzles can help increase the attention span in both adults and children. </li>
        <li>Improve Cognitive Ability</li>
        <li>Improve Productivity.</li>

      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>
          We tried to take things step by step while still being able to view progress as we move on. For this 
          part of the assignemt we took care a little bit about the design of our application because functionality isn’t everything.
          Like any web application our application have the following components:
          <ul>
              <li>Static contents like HTML.</li>
              <li>Client side files like CSS and Javascript</li>
              <li>Externel resourses like images and fonts </li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Web Application Root Directory</h3>
        <p>
            This is the main or Root folder of web application. Usually name of 
            this folder becomes your web application context.

        <p>
            This is the special directory under web application root directory. This is special because 
            the files available within this folder will not be accessible to client directly, he will have to login
            to have access to them.

        <h3>Adobe Illustrator</h3>
        <p>
            UI design skills are one of the most employable opportunities of our lifetime. Adobe Illustrator is a vector graphics editor developed and marketed by Adobe Systems.
            Using a project-based learning approach to Illustrator’s core features, walk through the process of designing a simple website
            beginning with making a wireframe, and then using that wireframe as the basis for creating a page mock up for mobile and desktop platforms.

      <h2>Future Plans</h2>
      <p>
      So much for the things we’ve done, but what about what we’re planning on doing? First of all, of course we want to implement the actual game.
      
      A great starting point would be to properly implement user accounts - after all, surely everyone wants to be the best. 
      A nice addition to the standard login and password would be to incorporate login via Google and Facebook, as plenty of other applications provide. 
      Having people connect with their Facebook or Google account can prove useful regarding other features we have in mind as well.
